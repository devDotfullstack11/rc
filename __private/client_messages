[6:50 AM, 6/29/2021] Harjeet Vlogic: On this screen here. Can we change History Payout to “Reward History” and move it down. In its place can we have a box that says “Tree Bank”
[6:51 AM, 6/29/2021] Harjeet Vlogic: Just text. The members can contribute with the top button “Contribute” and purchase trees planted. Two options. 

1.) Plant a tree in Canada ($2.99 + GST) 
And
2.) Plant a tree in a Canadian protection project (goes to tree bank) ($47.62 + gst) 

This way they can send in their contribution and load their “Tree Bank” below. They can have their all payment options here including the etransfer option and could send their contribution in advance.
[6:51 AM, 6/29/2021] Harjeet Vlogic: The admin would then credit their account when the etransfer was received.
[6:51 AM, 6/29/2021] Harjeet Vlogic: On the draw if they hit check out, it would say, “Pay with tree bank”, instead of pay with credit


===
When they pay by etransfer, the app would say, “please send your etransfer to rmrcp1@outlook.com and enter receipt number “xxxxxxxx” Thank you for your support.” The app would generate a receipt number and the admin app just needs to have a spot for etransfer orders. The admin would then receive the etransfer and match the receipt number and load there “Tree Bank” accordingly. If the app can do this automatically that would be great but we can do etransfers manually.

[7:11 PM, 7/1/2021] Harjeet: okay, once you confirm then we will read the documentation
[7:12 PM, 7/1/2021] Harjeet: Also, we need to check whether it supports to e-transfer or not
[7:23 PM, 7/1/2021] Chris: Etransfer is fine to build in as an option. The admins will manually accept etransfers and load the “Tree Bank”
[7:24 PM, 7/1/2021] Chris: The app just needs to generate a random code (receipt number) for the person to include in notes. This code will match in the app and in the transfer.

=============


For the groups listed below, if I clicked on one, “RMR” for example, it would show me which projects these were planted in

This section will show the draws that are full and either require scheduling or have been scheduled. An admin will get notified when a draw is full and it will be added to this area. From here they can schedule a draw time. When they do this it will get added to their announcements.

The way I had invisioned it working was that as soon as a draw filled it would go to the “schedule” screen. From here the admin could click on the draw from a list and select the time the draw will be held at. Once this was done an announcement for this would automatically be generated and on the “Schedule” list a draw time would be shown beside the tree drive. This would be the draw schedule for the admin

The admin would receive a notification when a tree drive was added to the list and requiring scheduling

Trees planted should view like the admin app.

==========

Instead of showing the group though, it only shows which projects trees were planted in.

When you select a group it should then show which projects the trees were planted in.

The tree drives are planting trees in different protection projects

This one you can see was for the Old Growth Management project in Quesnel, BC

On this screen can we add a spot to “Select Protection Project”

The protection project is the project the group is choosing to raise money for

The picture will be different based on which project they pick

=============
We will add 1 more number to determine page score based on volume. Volume will make up 30% of score. Pages doing below 50k will get 10% 100k+ will get 20% and 200K plus get 30%


one person rated the page 100% and 2 people rated the post 100% and one person 25% the calculation would look like this.

100 x 3 + 100 + 100 +25 = 525 / 6 = 87.5%

The page did 100k the previous month. 

87.5% of 70 = 61.25 + 20 = overall score 81.25%
